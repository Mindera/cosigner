  - Separate subject from body with a blank line
  - Limit the subject line to 50 characters
  - Capitalize the subject line
  - Do not end the subject line with a period
  - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
  - Wrap the body at 72 characters
  - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
